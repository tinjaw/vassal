The VASSAL Team is happy to announce the release of VASSAL 3.4.0-beta1, which is a preview release.

(If you're wondering why we're releasing 3.4.0-beta1 next after 3.3.3-beta1: You haven't missed 3.3.3. We decided that the next full release should be 3.4.0 due to added features.)

<h3>IMPORTANT</h3>
* Things may be broken which worked previously. If you find a new bug, please report it.

* If you save a module in VASSAL 3.3, you will NOT be able to open it afterwards with VASSAL 3.3 or earlier. We recommend keeping a backup copy of any pre-3.4 modules you plan to modify in 3.4 until you've verified that everything works to your satisfaction.

* Some modules containing custom drawing code may render incorrectly on HiDPI displays, starting with 3.3. If you are the maintainer of such a module, let us know and we can advise you about what needs updating for 3.4 in your code. (We are aware that VASL has this problem and are working with its maintainers to update it.)
