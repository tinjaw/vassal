/**
 * A Command represents an action that needs to be transmitted from one client to another - any action that could
 * change the game state of a multiplayer game should be encapsulated in a Command object. When performing actions
 * during the game, corresponding Commands will be logged in the correct logfile and/or sent to other players through
 * the server.
 *
 * {@link CommandEncoder}s then serialise ({@link CommandEncoder#encode}) and deserialise ({@link CommandEncoder#decode})
 * Commands to and from an ascii based representation. Commands are encoded by the generated client prior to being sent
 * across network or saved in a log or save file. Commands are decoded by the receiving client on receipt from the network
 * or on reading from a log or save file. Save game creation is a special case where every {@link GameComponent} is asked to
 * generate a Command that when executed will cause itself to be recreated in its present state.
 *
 * The {@link #execute} method implements the execution of the command and is called by the receiving client
 * after building the Command using <code>decode</code>. The <code>execute</code> method is sometimes called on the generating client but does
 * not need to be if the Command is being created to encapsulate something that has already happened on the generating client.
 *
 * Commands can be strung together into compound commands with the {@link #append} method. Although Commands can be linked into
 * compound commands this way, each {@link CommandEncoder} need only handle single (not compound) commands.
