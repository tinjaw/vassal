    <td valign="top">A Board represents the physical board on which pieces are moved by the players.&nbsp; A Map Window
    can consist of multiple Boards laid out next to one another.&nbsp; <br>
    <br>
    If a board image is specified (a GIF, JPEG, or PNG image file that must be created beforehand with some external
    tool), then the size of the image determines the size of the board. If the board image is set to null (by clicking
    the "Select" button and then canceling the file dialog), then no image is used for the board, and the size and color
    may be specified directly.<br>
    <br>
    To add a board to your map, use the Editor's configuration window to navigate to the <i>[Map Window]</i> entry for your map. Click
    to the left of it to open its subcomponents and you should find a <i>[Map Boards]</i> component. You can then right-click on the
    <i>[Map Boards]</i> component and select <i>Add Board</i>. You will then have a <i>[Board]</i> component for your map!<br>
    <br>
    <img src="images/BoardConfig.png"><br>
    <br>
    You can optionally add a <i>Grid</i> subcomponent to your board to regulate movement by right-clicking the <i>[Board]</i> component and selecting one of the
    appropriate <i>Add</i> options. See <i>Sub-Components</i>, below, for more details on grids.

  <h2>Sub-Components: Grids</h2>
  If a Board contains no grid, then pieces may be placed anywhere on the board.&nbsp; Pieces dropped on top of one
  another will stack.&nbsp; If the board contains a <a href="HexGrid.htm">Hex</a> or <a href="RectangularGrid.htm">
  Rectangular</a> grid, they can be configured either to allow pieces anywhere or to have pieces snap to the nearest
  legal location on the board as defined by the grid.&nbsp; The grid may be drawn over the board's image or drawing may
  be suppressed (for example if the image already has a grid drawn on it). <a href="IrregularGrid.htm">Irregular</a>
  grids may be used to define locations on maps where the positions are arbitrary; on such grids the option to have
  pieces snap to the nearest legal location is selectable. Maps can also be configured to use different grids in
  different zones through the use of a <a href="ZonedGrid.htm">Multi-zoned Grid</a>.<br>
