    The <i>Chat Log</i> appears at the top of the main Module window. It serves both to allow players to "chat" with each other by typing text
    into the blank at the bottom, but can also serve as a useful <i>log</i> of events that occur during the game, such as piece moves and dice rolls. A
    good chat log records the details of the game's history for the players, and becomes a resource for them to answer questions like "which unit took that hit
    last turn", or "how did the victory points marker get to 9?"<br>
    <br>
    VASSAL's chat log offers many opportunities for you to create a useful log stream for your players, including <b>bold</b>, <i>italics</i>, <b><span style="color:green;">colored text</span></b>,
    and even &nbsp;<img src="images/ChatLogDice.png"> dice images inserted directly into the chat log. A well-designed chat log can make "important events" stand out from 
    routine events -- notice in the example at right how changes in Victory Points are being announced in <b><span style="color:#ff6666;">Bold Bright Text</span></b> while
    game events are shown in <span style="color:#009933;"><i>Italicized green text with <b>1</b> or <b>2</b> highlights.</i></span> This makes them stand out from the standard
    black text of more routine events. This article will help you design your own chat log reporting so that you can get the most out of this feature.<br>
    <br>
    <h3>Quick Colors</h3>
    VASSAL provides several "quick color" shortcuts to allow colored text to be put into the chat log by <a href="ReportChanges.htm">Report Action</a> traits and other <a href="MessageFormat.htm">Message Formats</a>.
    This is done by placing a special character as the first character of a message. The special first character, if any, will be removed automatically from the message when it is displayed.
    Each of these characters activates one of the five chat log colors from the Chat Preferences tab; default colors are provided but players are allowed to reconfigure the colors as they wish.<br>
    <br>
    <i>EXAMPLE:</i> If a <a href="ReportChanges.htm">Report Action</a> trait's message said <i>Hello World.</i> and you wanted to change the text to green, you could simply change the
    message text to <i>!Hello World.</i> The exclamation point would be automatically removed, and the message would appear as <span style="color:#009933;">Hello World.</span>
    <br>

    <h3>HTML in Chat Log</h3>
    VASSAL's chat log now supports HTML as well as regular text, as long you turn on the proper <a href="GlobalOptions.htm">Global Options</a> setting (this is to maintain compatibility with
    modules created with earlier versions of VASSAL that did not account for such support). To turn on HTML support for your module, in the Editor window
    navigate to the <i>[Global Options]</i> component and open its <i>properties</i> dialog. Find the <i>Enable HTML support in Chat Log</i> option (see
    illustration at right) and set it to <i>Always</i>. Any message with a "Quick Colors" first character, including "|" will also parse HTML regardless of 
    the Global Options setting. <br>
    <br>
    With HTML support enabled, you can include many types of HTML tags in your <a href="ReportChanges.htm">Report Action</a> traits and other <a href="MessageFormat.htm">Message Formats</a>.
    This opens up even more possibilities than the Quick Colors shortcuts and allows you to create an unlimited number of new styles.<br>

    <h3>Dice Images in the Chat Log</h3>
    To create a dice button on the Toolbar that will display its results with images in the chat log, you will first of course need to create
    a <a href="SpecialDiceButton.htm">Symbolic Dice Button</a>. Follow the directions in that article to create a die, or start with a Symbolic Dice
    Button that you have already created. Now, in the <i>Report Format</i> field, instead of simply reporting your results as e.g. <i>$result1$ rolled by $PlayerName$</i>,
    you will use <i>$result1$</i> to substitute in part of the filename in an HTML &lt;img&gt; tag. In the illustration below, notice how the filename
    is created as <i>d6-$result1$-blue.png</i>. So the image files would be <i>d6-1-blue.png</i>, <i>d6-2-blue.png</i>, and so forth. The <i>width=14</i> and <i>height=14</i> stylings
    in the tag force the image to be displayed in that pixel size -- since you probably have dice images e.g. 32x32 pixels so that they fit nicely on the
    toolbar, this prevents you from needing to make new versions just to have smaller images of them in the chat log. You can of course omit the <i>width</i>
    and <i>height</i> styles and insert images of any size you want.<br>
    <br>
    As a little added touch, you could add <i>&lt;span style="color:#ffffff;"&gt;$result1$</i> to the end of your <i>Report Format</i> field. This causes
    the die roll result to also be printed out in text, but in "white-on-white" so that it will normally be invisible -- <i>except</i> if one of your players
    wants to cut-and-paste text out of the chat window. Since the dice images do not normally transfer to the clipboard, this ensures than even a cut-and-paste
    of the chat log will retain an accurate record of dice rolls.<br>
