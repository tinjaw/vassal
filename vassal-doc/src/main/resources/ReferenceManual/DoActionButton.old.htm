    <td valign="top">An Action Button component places a button on the Toolbar of the main Module window which combines a number of different
    actions into a single button. When the button is clicked, or receives its Hotkey, it can display a message to the
    Chat Log Window, Play a sound, and/or send a list of Hotkeys or <a href="NamedKeyCommand.htm">Named Key Commands</a> to other components.<br>
    <br>
    To add an Action Button to your Module, find the <i>[Module]</i> entry at the very top of the Editor's configuration window, right-click it,
    and select <i>Add Action Button</i>. Once you have performed the initial configuration of your new Action Button and clicked the OK button,
    your new <i>[Action Button]</i> component will be found at the very bottom of the Module's list of components.<br>
    <br>
    <b>Description:&nbsp;</b>An identifying name for this button.<br>
    <br>
    <b>Button text:&nbsp;</b>The text of the button to be added to the Toolbar.&nbsp;<br>

    <i>Global Hotkeys</i> rather than <i>Global Key Commands</i>, they are sent to Module and Map Toolbar components, <i>not</i> to individual Game Pieces. Of course a Hotkey could be used to activate a Global Key Command component
    which could then affect individual Game Pieces.<br>
