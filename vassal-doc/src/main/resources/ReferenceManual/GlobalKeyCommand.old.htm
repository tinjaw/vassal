    <td valign="top">This <a href="GamePiece.htm#Traits">Trait</a> adds an action that applies a key command to other pieces, similar to the <a
      href="Map.htm#GlobalKeyCommand">Global Key Command</a> component of a Map Window. Global Key Commands are the main
    avenue by which Pieces can prompt action by other Pieces. As such, they are very powerful, but they do come at the
    price of some performance lag, as each time one is issued Vassal must generally check it against every piece on the
    board.<br>
    <br>
    <b>Description:&nbsp;</b>A description of this trait, which appears in the Piece Definer list in the Editor.<br>
    <br>
    <b>Command name:&nbsp;</b>Name of the right-click context menu item. If left blank, no context menu item will appear.<br>
    <br>
    <b>Key Command:</b>&nbsp; A Key Command or <a href="NamedKeyCommand.htm">Named Key Command</a> that initiates the action. For example a keyboard
    shortcut which, when typed with this piece selected will cause the Global Key Command to be issued. This is <i>not</i>, however, the command that 
    will be issued to the other pieces (see next field).<br>
    <br>
    <b>Global Key Command:</b>&nbsp; The Key Command or <a href="NamedKeyCommand.htm">Named Key Command</a> that will be
    applied to other Pieces (and potentially this piece as well). As with all Key Commands, this can either be an actual
    keyboard shortcut like Ctrl+F, or a Named Key Command such as FireForwardPhasers. Other pieces which have that
    same shortcut or Named Key Command filled in as the Key Command for one or more of their <a href="GamePiece.htm#Traits">Traits</a> will have those
    traits activated.<br>
    <br>
    <b>Matching Properties:</b>&nbsp; The Global Key Command will only be applied to Game Pieces which match the specified <a
      href="PropertyMatchExpression.htm">Property Match Expression</a>. Note that the properties named in the expression
    are evaluated against the properties <i>of the target pieces</i>, not the properties of the piece issuing the Global Key Command. 
    For example if you provided the expression <i>{ CurrentZone == "Europe" }</i>, that would use the CurrentZone property 
    of each potential target piece (checking if <i>it</i> is "Europe") to determine whether or not to apply the Global Key Command. 
    If you want to compare a property in the target pieces against the value of <i>a property in <b>this</b> piece</i>, 
    then use $property$. All $...$ property references will be evaluated against this piece before testing against other pieces. 
    Note that this will often mean the expression needs to be put inside of quotation marks if the property in question is a string value. For example
    if the expression provided is { CurrentZone == "$CurrentZone$" } then the CurrentZone of each potential target piece
    will be checked against $CurrentZone$ which will read the CurrentZone of the <i>issuing</i> piece (see also example
    below).<br>
    <br>
    <b>Within a Deck, apply to:</b>&nbsp; Select how the Global Key Command will be applied to pieces in a <a href="Deck.htm">Deck</a>. Options
    are <i>All pieces</i>, <i>No pieces</i>, or <i>Fixed number of pieces</i>. If 
    <i>Fixed number of pieces</i> is selected, a field appears to allow entry of the number of Pieces in the Deck to
    affect, starting at the top of the Deck. Thus, selecting 1 for the fixed number would cause only the top card or
    piece in a Deck to be affected.<br>
    <br>
    <b>Restrict Range:</b>&nbsp; If selected, the command will only apply to pieces located within a specified distance
    of this piece.<a href="Properties.htm"></a><br>
    <br>
    <b>Range: &nbsp;</b> Only others pieces within this distance, inclusive, of this piece will have the command applied
    to them. If the pieces are on a board with a <a href="HexGrid.htm">Hex Grid</a> or <a href="RectangularGrid.htm">Rectangular Grid</a>, 
    then the distance is in units of the grid. Otherwise, the distance is measured in screen pixels.<br>
    <br>
    <b>Fixed Range:</b>&nbsp; If selected, then the range is specified as a fixed number. If unselected, then the range
    will be given by the value of the named <a href="Properties.htm">property</a>.
    <br>
    <br>
    <b>Range Property:</b>&nbsp; The name of a Property that contains the range to use when Fixed Range is not selected.
    <br>
    <br>
    <b></b><b>Suppress individual reports:</b>&nbsp; If selected, then any reports (whether auto-reporting or <a
      href="ReportChanges.htm">Report Action</a> traits) by the affected Pieces will be disabled throughout the
    processing of this Global Key Command. &nbsp; You may wish to use a <a href="ReportChanges.htm">Report Action</a>
    trait on this piece to provide a summary message in their place.
    <br>
    <br>
    <b>EXAMPLE 1 (see upper right):</b>&nbsp; A leader counter and infantry counters both have 
    <a href="PropertyMarker.htm">Marker</a> traits to specify their nationality and type.&nbsp; A <a href="Layer.htm">
    Layer</a> trait represents the rallied state of an infantry counter, uses <i>Ctrl+A</i> to activate the Layer, and
    uses <i>Rally</i> as the name.&nbsp; A Global Key Command on the leader counter can select and rally all infantry
    counters within two hexes of the same nationality that are not rallied by checking the boxes for <i>Restrict Range</i> 
    and <i>Fixed Range</i>, specifying <i>Range</i> of 2 and matching properties <i>{ type == "Infantry" } &amp;&amp; 
    { nation == "$nation$" } &amp;&amp; { Rally_Active == "false" }</i>.<br>
    <br>
    <b>EXAMPLE 2 (see below):</b>&nbsp; An Army unit that may stack with multiple generals can be given a command to
    "Put Senior General In Command" with the shortcut key command Alt+Ctrl+R. When the menu item or shortcut key are 
    activated, this trait sends the <a href="NamedKeyCommand.htm">Named Key Command</a> <i>CheckRANKS</i> to the pieces
    representing generals who might be put in command. Eligible generals are found by checking first if they have a
    property <i>Rank</i> which is &gt; 0, since only generals have ranks. Next their <i>Side</i> property ("Union" or "Confederate") is
    compared to a Global Property <i>ActiveSide</i> so that we don't accidentally put Ulysses Grant in command of the Confederate army. 
    Finally, we filter out Generals who aren't currently in play on the map (either they're in the reinforcement pool, the dead pool,
    or already in command of another army) by checking to make sure their CurrentZone name corresponds to one of the US or Confederate
    states in a string list ("Alabama, Arkansas, ...") contained in another Global Property.<br>
