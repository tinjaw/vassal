    The <i>Does not stack</i> trait's primary function is that it prevents a piece from forming stacks with other pieces on
    the board. Pieces with this trait can be placed at any pixel location on a map, and they will simply overlap with
    and/or partially or completely obscure or be obscured by any pieces they are placed on top of or beneath.<br>
    <br>
    This trait <i>also</i> controls how players interact with the piece when clicking on it, dragging it, or dragging a
    band-select box around a group of pieces. Note that any selection or movement limitations do not apply when the
    piece is moved automatically through the operation of one of its traits (e.g. a <a href="SendToLocation.htm">Send To
    Location</a> trait).<br>
    <br>
    <b>Select Piece:</b>&nbsp; This option controls what happens when a player tries to select a piece, e.g. by clicking
    on it. Options are:
    <ul>
      <li><i>normally:</i>&nbsp; The piece can be selected normally.</li>
      <li><i>when shift-key down:</i>&nbsp; A player must hold the Shift key down to select the piece.</li>
      <li><i>when alt-key down:</i>&nbsp; A player must hold the Alt key down to select the piece.</li>
      <li><i>never:</i>&nbsp; The piece can never be selected by a player.</li>
    </ul>
    <b>Band-Select Piece:</b>&nbsp; This option controls what happens when a player draws a band-select box or "lasso"
    around a group of pieces and this piece lies within the boundaries of the band-select. This can be used to prevent
    e.g. a certain class of terrain markers or immobile markers from being swept up in band-selects when only pieces are
    desired, but still allowing these markers to be clicked on directly and be selected.
    <ul>
      <li><i>normally:</i>&nbsp; The piece can be band-selected normally.</li>
      <li><i>when alt-key down:</i>&nbsp; A player must hold the Alt key down when band-selecting in order for this piece
        to be added to the selection.</li>
        <li><i>never:</i>&nbsp; The piece is never selected by band-selects.</li>
    </ul>
    <b>Move Piece:&nbsp</b>This option controls what happens when a player tries to move a selected piece by
    drag-and-drop. Options are:
    <ul>
      <li><i>normally:</i>&nbsp; The piece can be moved normally.</li>
      <li><i>only if selected:</i>&nbsp; The piece can only by moved if it is selected.</li>
      <li><i>never</i>&nbsp; The piece can never be moved manually by a player.</li>
    </ul>
    <b>Ignore grid when moving?</b>&nbsp; Select this option to prevent the piece from snapping to the nearest grid
    location when it is moved. This overrides any setting configured in a <a href="HexGrid.htm">Hex Grid</a>, <a href="IrregularGrid.htm">Irregular Grid</a>, or <a href="RectangularGrid.htm">Rectangular Grid</a>.
    <br/>
    <br>
    <b>EXAMPLE:</b> Use non-stacking pieces to represent playing cards in games that mix cards and counters, so that the
    cards can be placed on a map without interfering with stacks of counters.&nbsp; <br>
    <br>
    <b>EXAMPLE:</b> Pieces that represent map features, such as destroyed bridges or control markers, can use the
    <i>Move piece never</i> option so that players do not inadvertently move them around. They could also be filtered out of
    band-selects, while still being allowed to be selected when clicked on directly, so that players can still modify
    and/or delete them as the game progresses.</td>
