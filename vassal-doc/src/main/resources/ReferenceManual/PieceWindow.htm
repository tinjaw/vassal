    <td valign="top">The Game Piece Palette is a panel which contains Game Pieces that the players may drag to the
    playing area during a game. An unlimited supply of each Game Piece is available through the palette. If
    you need to limit the number of pieces available during play, use a <a href="Deck.htm">Deck</a>, an <a
      href="SetupStack.htm">At-Start Stack</a>, or <a href="GameModule.htm#PredefinedSetup">Default Setups</a>.<br>
    <br>
    If the player has the <i>Use combined application window</i> preference checked, then the first Game Piece Palette
    in the module will dock into the main module window to the left of the chat log. All others will appear in
    their own window.<br>
    <br>
    <b>Name:</b>&nbsp; If the palette appears in its own window, this will be used for the title.<br>
    <br>
    <b>Hidden:</b>&nbsp; If checked, then this Game Piece Palette will not appear at all during play. This is
    useful if you need to define pieces for a <a href="GameModule.htm#PredefinedSetup">Default Setup</a> but don't want
    to allow players to create new pieces during play. You must restart VASSAL for this change to take effect.<br>
    <br>
    <b>Button Text:</b>&nbsp; The text on the Toolbar button that shows and hides the Game Piece Palette.<br>
    <br>
    <b>Button Icon:</b>&nbsp; The icon image on the Toolbar button.<br>
    <br>
    <b>Hotkey:</b>&nbsp; A keyboard shortcut or <a href="NamedKeyCommand.htm">Named Key Command</a> for the Toolbar
    button.<br>
    <br>
    <b>Image scale for all child members:</b>&nbsp; A scale factor to be used to draw the images for pieces displayed by
    this panel or its members. If an inner widget (e.g. a panel, a list, etc) contains its own scaling factor, that one
    overrides any factor provided in an outer member.<br>
    <br>
    The Game Piece Palette is highly configurable, and can contain any combination of tabs, lists, and pull-down
    menus containing individual Game Pieces. For example, the window may contain a tabbed pane with two entries,
    called "Info" and "Armies", each of which contain a list of pieces. Every component in the Toolbar should end
    with a Single Piece. Since a typical game has many pieces that differ in only minor ways, you may find it
    convenient to clone Single Pieces. Also, the order of the pieces can be changed by dragging them within the
    configuration tree.<br>
