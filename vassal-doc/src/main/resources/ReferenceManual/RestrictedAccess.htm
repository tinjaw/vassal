    <td valign="top">This trait allows you to specify player side(s) to whom this piece belongs. The side(s) must be
    chosen from among those listed in the module's <a href="GameModule.htm#Definition_of_Player_Sides">Definition of
    Player Sides.</a> 
    Only players playing one of the specified sides will be able to modify certain traits of this Game Piece. Other
    players will not see menu items corresponding to traits appearing <i>before</i> this trait in the list of traits for
    the Game Piece, and the corresponding key commands will do nothing. Thus, this trait is similar to <a
      href="Hideable.htm">Invisible</a> traits and <a href="Mask.htm">Mask</a> traits in that it should be placed below
    the traits it is intended to "protect".<br>
    <br>
    <b>Belongs to side:</b>&nbsp; Enter the list of sides to whom this piece belongs. To add a new side, type it into
    the blank and then click the <i>Add</i> button. To remove a side, select it in the list at right and click the <i>
    Remove</i> button.<br>
    <br>
    <b>Also belongs to initially-placing player:</b>&nbsp; When this option is checked, then the player who initially
    clicks on the piece or first places it on any map will become the owner, in addition to listed sides. It is a good
    idea to specify at least one side when using this option. Otherwise, any pieces created by an observer will not be
    able to be removed. If, during a game, a player clicks the <i>Retire</i> button to become an observer, then all
    pieces owned by that player become owned by nobody, even if the player was already an observer. If you are creating
    a <a href="GameModule.htm#PredefinedSetup">Pre-defined Setup</a>, always <i>Retire</i> before saving so that players
    loading the game, rather than you, will own the pieces in the setup.<br>
    <br>
    <b>Prevent non-owning players from moving piece?</b>&nbsp; Use this option to prevent non-owning players from moving
    the piece, as well as disabling access to the piece commands. <br>
    <br>
    Pieces in a Game Piece Palette can be manipulated by anybody so long as no game is in progress.<br>
