    <td valign="top">The <i>Return to Deck</i> is used to move a piece into a <a href="Deck.htm">Deck</a> when the
    designated key command is received or the right-click context menu item is selected. If there is only one Deck in
    the module the piece will be added to it. If the module has more than one Deck, you may select the Deck that the
    piece will be placed in. Alternatively, you may prompt the players to choose a deck when the trait is activated.<br>
    <br>
    <b>Menu Text:&nbsp;</b> Text for the right-click context menu option that will move the piece to the Deck. If left
    blank, no context menu item will appear but the trait can still be activated by the Key Command.<br/>
    <br>
    <b>Keyboard Command:&nbsp;</b> The keyboard shortcut or <a href="NamedKeyCommand.htm">Named Key Command</a> that
    initiates moving this piece to the Deck.<br/>
    <br>
    <b>Choose destination deck at game time?</b>&nbsp; Check this option to let the player select a Deck to use at the
    time the trait is activated as opposed to predefining which Deck to return to beforehand.<br/>
    <br>
    <b>Select Deck</b>&nbsp; To designate in advance the Deck for the piece to be returned to, click the <i>Select Deck
    </i> button. You will be shown the configuration tree for your module (the same tree you see when editing the
    module), and must navigate to and select the Deck you wish to be the target.<br>
    <br>
    <b>Prompt for destination deck:</b>&nbsp; Text to display when asking the player to select a Deck to return the piece
    to.<br/>
    <br/>             
    <b>EXAMPLE:</b> <br>
    For a game in which cards are drawn from a deck, used, and placed into a discard pile, both the deck and the discard
    pile will be represented by a Deck component. By adding a Return to Deck trait to each card, with the text 'Discard'
    and the command <i>Ctrl+R</i>, then hitting <i>Ctrl+R</i> on with a card selected will automatically send it to the discard pile.
